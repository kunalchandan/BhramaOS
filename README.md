# BhramaOS
My first attempt at a physics engine.

This physics engine currently has the capability to support:
* Objects with charges
* Collisions
* Spheres

As I continue building the project, I will continue to update the README.

### Reasoning
I am working on this project solely as a fun thing to do, if you would like to use this or any of the code in here. Please feel free, if you don't mind, please mention me in the credits of your project.

I hope to take this project to the point of a 2D molecule builder, at some point I may consider converting this to 3D.
